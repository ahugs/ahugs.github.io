I am a PhD student at the Univesity of Montreal and the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (Mila) advised by Prof. Glen Berseth.  I received my Bachelor in Science of Engineering (Summa Cum Laude) from Princeton University in 2014 where I majored in Operations Research and Financial Engineering with a certificate in Applications of Computing. Before rejoining academia, I spent several years as a data scientist working on applied machine learning projects at various institutions including Honey/Paypal, Uplight and Citi.

My research interests lie in enabling real-world reinforcement learning including how to best incorporate offline data, learning reward and cost functions, exploration and safety. I am interested in applications of reinforcement learning that could improve our sustainble use of finite resources, including power grids, supply chains and robotics.
